Kubecoin Booth Primer
---------------------

#### Motivation

Kubecoin is an experiment to poke at capturing personal (health) information in a private, respectful, secure and trustworthy way.

It was also created as a fun, and interesting way to put IBM Cloud technology in the hands and pockets of developers, among other things it uses the following IBM Technology:

- IBM Cloud Container Service
- IBM Cloud Functions
- IBM Blockchain
- IBM Mongo Database by Compose
- IBM Cloud Foundry
- IBM MQTT Service

The backend is written in Node.JS, the iOS app in Swift 4 and the Android app in Java.

It was developed by Anthony Amanse, Ishan Gulhane, Hovig Ohannessian, Raheel Zubairy

Here's a high level overview of the technology:
